    <h1>Healthy Food Choices</h1>

    <p>
      To have a healthy lifestyle, you should first, have healthy food choices.
      The food we eat is very important to our body. Our body depends on the
      energy we get from food. We should eat a lot of fruits and vegetables to
      give our body the vitamins and minerals it needs to survive.

    <h2 class="title2">Fruits and Vegetables</h2>

    <p class="text">
      Fruit and vegetables are a good source of vitamins and minerals, including
      folate, vitamin C and potassium. They're an excellent source of dietary
      fibre, which can help to maintain a healthy gut and prevent constipation
      and other digestion problems. A diet high in fibre can also reduce your
      risk of bowel cancer. They can help to reduce your risk of heart disease,
      stroke and some types of cancer. Fruit and vegetables contribute to a
      healthy, balanced diet. Fruit and vegetables taste delicious and there's
      so much variety to choose from.Fruit and vegetables are also usually low
      in fat and calories (provided you do not fry them or roast them in lots of
      oil). That's why eating them can help you maintain a healthy weight and
      keep your heart healthy.

    <h2 class="title2">Hydration</h2>

    <p class="text">
      Drinking enough water each day is crucial for many reasons: to regulate
      body temperature, keep joints lubricated, prevent infections, deliver
      nutrients to cells, and keep organs functioning properly. Being
      well-hydrated also improves sleep quality, cognition, and mood. Experts
      recommend drinking roughly 11 cups of water per day for the average woman
      and 16 for men. And not all of those cups have to come from plain water;
      for example, some can come from water flavored with fruit or vegetables
      (lemons, berries, or orange or cucumber slices), or from coffee or tea.
